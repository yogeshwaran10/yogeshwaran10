# Hey there, I'm Yogesh! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the code universe. I’m a tech enthusiast, AI explorer, and all-around geek who loves building stuff, breaking stuff, and fixing it again (preferably before my coffee runs out).

## About Me 🚀

- 🎓 I’m currently pursuing my **M.Tech in Information Technology** at **College of Engineering, Guindy** (because why settle for one degree when you can have two?).
- 💻 I’m diving deep into **Generative AI, Cloud Computing, Databases, Full Stack Development**, and all things **Tech**.
- 💪 When I’m not coding, you can find me **bulking** (because who says tech nerds can’t lift?).
- 🌍 Living in the land of **idli** and **dosa** (aka Tamil Nadu, India). 🇮🇳
  
## My GitHub Projects 👨‍💻

1. **[Anemia Detection Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/yogeshwaran10/Anemia_detection)**  
   🚑 A Random Forest model predicting whether you're anemic or not. Built with **Python, Flask, Scikit-learn**, and some **SMOTE magic**. It works wonders, and so does my diet plan! 

2. **[Robust Classification of Human-Written vs LLM-Generated Essays](https://github.com/yogeshwaran10/Robust-Classification-of-Human-written-vs-LLM-Generated-Essay)**  
   ✍️ A model that tells whether your essay was written by a human or a **LLM**. It’s like your AI “turing test,” but with fewer existential crises.

## Skills 👨‍🔬

- 🧑‍💻 **Languages:** Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript  
- 📚 **AI/ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn  
- 🌐 **Web Development:** Flask, Node.js, React  
- 🛠️ **Tools/Tech:** Git, Linux, Docker, SQL  
- 🧑‍🔬 **Other Interests:** Cloud Computing, Databases, Cybersecurity, Generative AI

## Fun Fact 🤓

If **Google** can’t find an answer to your problem, don't worry — I’ve probably already solved it and **forgotten** to push it to GitHub. 😅 But hey, that’s what issues are for, right?

So, here’s to less explaining, more coding, and definitely more coffee! ☕
