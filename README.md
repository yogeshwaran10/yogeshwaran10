# Hey there, I'm Yogesh! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the code universe. A tech enthusiast I am, AI explorer I be, and all-around geek who loves building stuff, breaking stuff, and fixing it again (preferably before my coffee runs out, hmm?). A coder’s work never done, it is!

## About Me 🚀

- 🎓 Pursuing my **M.Tech in Information Technology** at **College of Engineering, Guindy** (Why settle for one degree when two, hmmm?)
- 💻 Diving deep into **Generative AI, Cloud Computing, Databases, Full Stack Development**, and all things **Tech** I am. Like a sponge, absorbing knowledge I do!
- 💪 When not coding, find me **bulking** you will (because who says tech nerds can't lift, hmm?). Strength, in both mind and body, I seek.
- 🌍 In the land of **idli** and **dosa** (aka Tamil Nadu, India) I reside. 🇮🇳 Perfected my spice tolerance, I have.

## My GitHub Projects 👨‍💻

1. **[Anemia Detection Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/yogeshwaran10/Anemia_detection)**  
   🚑 A Random Forest model predicting whether you’re anemic or not, it is. Built with **Python, Flask, Scikit-learn**, and some **SMOTE magic**. Works wonders, it does, and so does my diet plan! 

2. **[Robust Classification of Human-Written vs LLM-Generated Essays](https://github.com/yogeshwaran10/Robust-Classification-of-Human-written-vs-LLM-Generated-Essay)**  
   ✍️ A model to tell if your essay was written by a human, or a **LLM**. Your AI "turing test" it is, but with fewer existential crises, yes. Confused, the AI is not. Human or machine, it knows.

## Skills 👨‍🔬

- 🧑‍💻 **Languages:** Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript  
- 📚 **AI/ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn  
- 🌐 **Web Development:** Flask, Node.js, React  
- 🛠️ **Tools/Tech:** Git, Linux, Docker, SQL  
- 🧑‍🔬 **Other Interests:** Cloud Computing, Databases, Cybersecurity, Generative AI, Wisdom of the Force, I seek

## Social 🧑‍💻

- 📝 **LinkedIn:** [Let's Connect! 🤝](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogeshwaran10)

## Fun Fact 🤓

If **Google** can't find an answer to your problem, hmm, don’t worry — solved it I probably have and **forgotten** to push it to GitHub, I did. 😅 But hey, that’s what issues are for, right? Patience, you must have. The answer will come.

More coding, less explaining, and definitely more coffee — to that, I toast! ☕
